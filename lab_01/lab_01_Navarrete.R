# Template R-script for ECo 634 fall 2020: Lab 01

# Use this template script to do your work.


# ---- Question 1 ----

# Run the following two lines of code in the console and explain the differences in output:

c(1, 2, 3)
"c(1, 2, 3)"




# ---- Question 2 ----

# Run the following two lines of code in the console and consider the differences:

c_1 = c(1, 2, 3)
c_2 = "c(1, 2, 3)"
c_1
c_2
class(c_1)
class(c_2)

# Q1. Is c_1 a variable, or a function?
# Q2. Is c_2 a variable, or a function?
# Q3. If c_1 and c_2 have different values, why?



# ---- Question 3: Matrices 1 ----

# Create a numeric vector of length 3 called my_vec. It should contain the integers from 1 to 3.
my_vec = c(1,2,3)
my_vec

my# Build a matrix using the following code:
mat_1 = matrix(my_vec)
mat_1


# Q1 (1pt.): What are the dimensions of the matrix (i.e. how many rows and columns)?
# The matrix has 3 rows and 1 column.
# Q2 (2pts.): Write R code to retrieve the element of mat_1 that has a value of 3.
mat_1[3,1]
mat_1[3,]


# ---- Question 4: Matrices 2 ----
# You will use my_vec from the previous question again.
# Create a matrix mat_2 that has two rows and three columns using my_vec. Do not use the c() or rep() functions.
# Create a matrix mat_3 that has three rows and two columns using my_vec. Do not use the c() or rep() functions.

# Q1 (1pt.): Paste the code you used to create mat_2.
mat_2 = matrix(my_vec,nrow=2,ncol=3)
mat_2
# Q2 (1pt.): Paste the code you used to create mat_3.
mat_3 = matrix(my_vec,nrow=3,ncol=2)
mat_3
# Q3 (1pt.): Did R use rows or columns to recycle the values in my_vec?
# Q4 (1pt.): Create a matrix, mat_4, with a number of elements that is not a multiple of 3 and paste the code into the editor.
my_vec2 = c(1:7)
mat_4 = matrix(my_vec2,nrow = 3,ncol = 3)
mat_4
# Q5 (1pt.): How did R handle the recycling of values of my_vec in mat_4?



# ---- Question 5: List subsetting challenge question ----
# Create a list, named my_list_1 with following three elements:
# first element is numeric: 5.2
# second element is a string "five point two"
# third element is a vector of all integers from 0 to 5. Do recall how to do this from the DataCamp course?

my_list_1 = 

# Name the elements in my_list_1:
# "two"
# "one"
# "three"
# Run the following lines of code.

my_list_1[[1]]
my_list_1[[as.numeric("1")]]
my_list_1[["1"]]
my_list_1[["one"]]
my_list_1$one
my_list_1$"one"
my_list_1$1 
my_list_1$"1"




# Q1 (8 pts): for each subsetting operation, explain why R produced the corresponding output.
# Identify the type of subsetting operation.
# Explain how the operation chose which element (1, 2, or 3) to return.

# Q2 (2 pts): Hypothesize why some of the lines may have produced errors or NULL outputs.
# Q3 (2 pts): Identify which lines produced the same output and explain why.
