#Lab Questions
#Question 01: Standard error of the mean function
#Recall your sse_mean() function. Your function should accept a single numeric vector and return a numeric value:

sse_mean = function (x) 
{
  n = length(x)-length(x[is.na(x)])
  standard_dev = sd(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  return(
    standard_dev / sqrt(n)
  )
}

?sd

sse_mean(penguins$body_mass_g)
sse_mean(mtcars$mpg)

#Question 02: Two-sample resampling function
#Your two_group_resample() funciton should accpet three arguments;

#x: A numeric vector
#n_1: The number of values (with replacement) to take from x for the first group.
#n_2: The number of values (with replacement) to take from x for the second group.
#Your function should return:
  
 #A single numeric value: the difference in means between the two groups

#Question 03: Resampling penguin data: histogram
#Use your two_group_resample() function along with a loop to generate 2000 resampled differences of means for flipper length between the two penguin species.

#-Hint: see the Resampling simulations section in the lab walkthrough for an example of how to do this.

#Question 04: Resampling penguin data: significance

#sum_dif_neg = sum(abs(mean_differences) < -5.8)

#sum_dif_tot = sum_dif_pos + sum_dif_neg

#sum_dif_tot

#Question 05: Resampling: p-value
#Recall this interpretation of a Frequentist p-value:
  
#How often would I expect to see a result as extreme, or more extreme, if the null hypothesis were true.

#The p-value from the t-test for the difference in mean flipper length was very very small:
  
#6.049e-08
#Thatâ€™s less than once in 10 million!
  # Question
#Given a p value of less than 1 per 10 million, how many simulations do you think you would have to do to see a difference in mean flipper length equal to or greater than 5.8 mm?

#Answer: 10 million

#Question 06: Resampling
#Try out your two_group_resample() on one of the other variables in the penguin data set.

#Instructions:
#  Choose another variable of penguin data from dat_pen.
#Create a boxplot of the data from your chosen column in dat_pen, grouped by species.
#See the walkthrough
#Use aggregate() to calculate the group means and the difference in means.
#Write the difference in means into a variable called diff_crit
#Conduct a t-test and observe p-value.
#Conduct a resampling test with 1000 repetitions using your two_group_resample() function.
